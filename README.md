> **Abstract**
> EEG emotion recognition faces significant hurdles due to
 noise interference, signal nonstationarity, and the inherent complexity of
 brain activity which make accurately emotion classification. In this study,
 we present the Fourier Adjacency Transformer, a novel framework that
 seamlessly integrates Fourier-based periodic analysis with graph-driven
 structural modeling. Our method first leverages novel Fourier-inspired
 modules to extract periodic features from embedded EEG signals, effec
tively decoupling them from aperiodic components. Subsequently, we em
ploy an adjacency attention scheme to reinforce universal inter-channel
 correlation patterns, coupling these patterns with their sample-based
 counterparts. Empirical evaluations on SEED and DEAP datasets demon
strate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques,
 achieving an improvement of approximately 6.5% in recognition accu
racy. By unifying periodicity and structural insights, this framework of
fers a promising direction for future research in EEG emotion analysis.
